# celaut-packer-service

A Celaut microVM service that **does the same thing `nodo pack` does**, exposed
over HTTP. Give it a project archive (a zip with a `Dockerfile`, a
`pack_config.json` and a `service.json`); it builds the image, exports the
filesystem, serialises a content-addressed `celaut.Service`, and returns the
packed service as a single **`.celaut.bee`** file.

It is a thin wrapper around the *real* nodo packer
(`src/packers/zip_with_dockerfile.py`), **vendored in-repo** under
[`vendor/nodo/`](vendor/nodo/) — not a re-implementation — so the `service_id`
it emits is byte-identical to `nodo pack`. The vendored tree is the exact
transitive import closure of the packer worker (packer + `src.utils` /
`src.manager.resources` + the `protos/` package); the image no longer clones
nodo at build time, so this service is self-contained and unaffected when nodo
drops its local Docker packer.

Since **v0.2.0** the same microVM also serves a **browser VS Code** on `:8443`
(see [Browser IDE](#browser-ide-code-server)) so users can pick a language
template, edit, and pack a service end-to-end without any local toolchain.

## API

Bound on `0.0.0.0:8080` (declared in `service.json`).

| Method | Path      | Body                | Response |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| GET    | `/health` | —                   | `200 ok` |
| POST   | `/pack`   | project `.zip`      | `200` → `application/octet-stream` (`.celaut.bee`); header `X-Service-Id: <hex>`; `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<id>.celaut.bee"` |

Errors: `415` (not a zip), `400` (config or packing error), `413` (too large),
`500` (unexpected).

**Config validation:** before building, the `.service` configuration is checked
and any problems are returned as a numbered, plain-English list (invalid JSON
with line/column, missing/wrong `architecture`, no entrypoint, malformed `api`
slots, the `dependencies_env`+array trap, …) pointing at `SERVICE_CONFIG_GUIDE.md`.
A bad config gets an actionable message instead of a cryptic Docker build
failure. Example body:

```
Your .service configuration has 2 problems:

  1. "architecture" is required in service.json. Add "architecture": "linux/amd64". (SERVICE_CONFIG_GUIDE.md → architecture)
  2. no entrypoint declared — the service has nothing to run. Add "init": { "entry_path": ["app", "start.sh"] } ...

Fix and re-pack. Full field reference: SERVICE_CONFIG_GUIDE.md.
```

The zip must contain, at its root **or** inside a single top-level folder:
`Dockerfile`, `service.json`, and optionally `pack_config.json`.

### Example

```bash
# zip a project (the same layout nodo pack expects)
( cd examples/hello && zip -r - . ) > /tmp/hello.zip

# pack it via the running service
curl -sS -X POST --data-binary @/tmp/hello.zip \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/zip' \
     -D /tmp/headers.txt -o /tmp/hello.celaut.bee \
     http://<service-ip>:8080/pack

grep -i x-service-id /tmp/headers.txt   # the content-addressed id
```

## How it works (architecture)

   │  → export rootfs → walk fs → build celaut.Service protobuf
   │  → multiblock dir + content hash = service_id
   ▼
bee_rpc.read_multiblock_directory(service_dir) → bytes  →  <id>.celaut.bee
```

`start.sh` boots an in-VM Docker daemon (DinD) and a host-network `buildx`
builder, then runs `server.py`. **This is why the service declares
`network: tag=(*)`** — buildx must reach arbitrary container registries to pull
the base images referenced by the Dockerfile being packed.

### Multi-arch (amd64 + arm64 via qemu)

The packer runs on an **amd64 host**, but it can pack services for **both
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`**. After the in-VM dockerd is up, `start.sh`
registers qemu `binfmt_misc` handlers (`tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm64`,
pulled over the `tag=(*)` egress) so `buildx` can build arm64 images under
emulation. The target architecture is taken from each service's
`service.json` `"architecture"` field; supported values are configured via
`PACKER_ARCHES` (default `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`) and qemu registration can be
disabled with `PACKER_ENABLE_QEMU=0`.

Crucially, **arm-via-qemu builds stay deterministic**: the content-addressed
`service_id` is byte-identical across repeated packs of the same arm64 input, so
emulation does not weaken the packing contract.

## Browser IDE (code-server)

The image also installs **code-server** (VS Code in the browser), served on the
second api slot `:8443`. `start.sh` seeds a `/workspace` and launches it
(`--auth none`; access is mediated by the nodo network/DNAT layer) before
handing the foreground to the packer server.

The workspace ships everything needed to build a Celaut service:

- **`START_HERE.md`** — the landing guide.
- **`SERVICE_CONFIG_GUIDE.md`** — the full upstream configuration reference
  ([zip_with_dockerfile README](https://github.com/celaut-project/nodo/blob/stable/src/commands/packer/zip_with_dockerfile/README.md)),
  always bundled at the workspace root and inside every service you create.
- **`templates/<lang>/`** — 8 preconfigured language templates, each with a
  ready `.service` config (`Dockerfile` + `service.json` + `pack_config.json`),
  a `start.sh`, and minimal buildable source:
  `python`, `go`, `rust`, `node-express`, `node-typescript`, `java-spring`,
  `java-gradle`, `php-laravel`.
- **`.vscode/tasks.json`** — a *New service from template* task that pops a
  language picker, plus a *Pack this service* task.

Two helper CLIs are on `PATH` in the IDE terminal:

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `new-service <lang> [name]` | Scaffold a template into the workspace (and drop the config guide inside it). |
| `pack-service [dir]` | Zip a project and `POST` it to the local packer (`:8080`), saving `<service-id>.celaut.bee` next to it. |

So the full loop — **pick a template → edit → pack → get a `.celaut.bee`** —
happens inside one sealed microVM.

| Port | Service |
|---|---|
| `8080` | Packer HTTP API (`/health`, `/pack`) |
| `8443` | code-server (browser VS Code) |

## Bootstrap / dogfood test

The acceptance test from the brief is a two-step bootstrap:

1. **Pack the packer with the node.** On an amd64 + KVM node:
   `nodo pack celaut-packer-service` → `celaut-packer-service` gets a
   real service-id; `nodo execute` it to get a running instance with an IP.
2. **Pack another service with the packer.** Zip e.g. `examples/hello` (or
   `celaut-sat-solver`) and `POST /pack` it to the running packer instance. The
   returned `.celaut.bee` / `X-Service-Id` must match what `nodo pack` produces
   for the same project. `nodo import <id>.celaut.bee` should accept it.

## Validation status

Verified end-to-end on an amd64 + KVM host, running the packer as a privileged
Docker-in-Docker container:

- **amd64 dogfood — node == service.** `nodo pack examples/hello` and the
  service's `POST /pack` produce the **same** `service_id`
  (`8eff6cd8…a79d26c7`), deterministically on both legs.
- **arm64 via qemu — deterministic.** With qemu `binfmt` registered, the same
  `linux/arm64` project packed repeatedly yields a **byte-identical**
  `service_id` (`8783b238…2d0e65be`) and identical `.bee` size each run —
  emulation does not introduce non-determinism.

Determinism depends on two upstream-nodo fixes that are **baked into the
vendored source** under `vendor/nodo/` (search for `DETERMINISM PATCH`);
without them packing is non-reproducible. The Dockerfile asserts both are
present so a regression fails the build:

1. **sorted directory walk** — `recursive_parsing` iterates `os.listdir()`
   sorted, so branch order is stable across extractions.
2. **zeroed symlink mtime** — `filesystem_xattrs.metadata_from_lstat` hashes
   `mtime_ns = 0`; `tarfile` otherwise reassigns symlink mtimes to wall-clock on
   every extract.

protobuf must be the **pure-python** implementation on both legs (the `upb`
C backend has unstable map ordering across runs).

### Notes & remaining work

- **Execution target.** The proven path runs the packer as a privileged DinD
  container. Running it inside a sealed cloud-hypervisor microVM additionally
  requires the runtime to allow a nested Docker daemon (privileged / overlay /
  netfilter) and egress for `buildx` to pull base images.
- **Open cross-check.** arm64 is proven *service-self-deterministic* (repeat
  packs match); the node-side `nodo pack` arm64 == service cross-check is still
  to be closed (register qemu on the host docker, then compare to `8783b238…`).
